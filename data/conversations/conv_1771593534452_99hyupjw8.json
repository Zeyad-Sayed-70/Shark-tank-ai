Here are a few standout ones from your search results:\n\n1. **Rebel Cheese** – A high-end vegan creamery using cave-aging techniques for plant-based cheeses. They asked for $750,000 for 5% equity.\n2. **The Cutting Board with a Tray** – A specialty cutting board designed by a firefighter’s family. They secured a deal with *all five Sharks* for $100,000 for 20% equity, with profits going to charity!\n3. **Nourish + Bloom Market** – An AI-powered autonomous grocery store for food deserts. The pitch was called \"hellishly complicated\" by the entrepreneurs.\n4. **Flora** – A smart plant-care system with a sensor and app. They struck a deal with Lori Greiner for $300,000 for 15% equity plus royalties.\n5. **MinusCal** – A health snack bar claiming to block fat absorption.
